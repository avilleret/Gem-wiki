AVI movie loader (W32)

On W7 (32bit/MSVC), [filmAVI](filmAVI) have been tested with video files in `examples/data folder`. 
With `alea.mpg` and `anim-1.mov` I got `[pix_film:AVI]: Unable to open file: (file path)`
And with `homer.avi` : `|pix_film:AVI]: Could not find decompressor: (file path)`
So I'm wondering which codec this plugin should support.
