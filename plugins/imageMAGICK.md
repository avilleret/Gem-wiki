image loader/saver using ImageMagick

# Description


It either uses Magick++ (C++-bindings) or MagickCore (C-bindings), whatever is
available.

It works on Windows 7 (but not widely tested), but it has been build against a static library, so I have to copy 285 dll besides pd.exe which is not very convinient...
