movie loader using Carbon/QuickTime (OSX)

# Description

Apple has never ported *QuickTime* to 64bit (starting with OSX-10.5).
Therefore, this plugin will only work in *32bit* mode.
Furthermore, starting with OSX-10.9, even the 32bit Frameworks have been removed.

# Status

Only works on a limited (and diminishing) number of systems (OSX<10.9, 32bit mode).

*End of Life*
