movie output using Appleâ€™s QuickTime (OSX, W32)


# Description

Apple has never ported *QuickTime* to 64bit (starting with OSX-10.5).
Therefore, this plugin will only work in *32bit* mode.
Furthermore, starting with OSX-10.9, even the 32bit Frameworks have been removed.

The W32 version might still be available and usable though.

# Status

Only works on a limited (and diminishing) number of systems (W32, OSX<10.9, 32bit mode).
