videoSGI - video grabber for SGIs
===

This plugin should access the cameras of *old* SGI/irix machines,
like the **Indy** or the **O2**.

The actual plugin was ported from the original `[pix_videoSGI]` object,
but has never been tested in real life, since those SGIâ€™s are now long gone.

If you happen to own such a machine, your help is appreciated.
