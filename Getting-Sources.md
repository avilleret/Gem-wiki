## Getting a ZIP-file

If you just want to build the last version of Gem but you do not planned to make modifications in the code, let's get a tarball from sourceforge or github of a fresh snapshot.

“Download a zip” here: [https://github.com/umlaeute/Gem](https://github.com/umlaeute/Gem)

or

“Download snapshot” here: [http://sourceforge.net/p/pd-gem/gem/ci/master/tree/](http://sourceforge.net/p/pd-gem/gem/ci/master/tree/)


## Staying up to date

If you want to work on the code, you should make sure you have the newest version of it available.
We are using `git` to keep track of all the changes:

~~~~bash
$ git clone https://github.com/umlaeute/Gem.git
~~~~

Every now and then (and esp. before starting to hack on something), you should refresh your local copy:

~~~~bash
$ cd Gem
$ git pull
~~~~
