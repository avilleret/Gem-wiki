Contributing to Gem development
====

Gem-development is quite short on manpower.
So if you want to contribute, you are very welcome.

# What can you do

 - fix bugs

 - implement features

 - write documentation

 - write help-patches

 - provide nice examples

 - ...

# Communication

## Mailinglist

Virtually all communication regarding the development of Gem, happens on the
[Gem-dev mailinglist](http://lists.puredata.info/listinfo/gem-dev).

If you want to contribute, you are invited (and urged :-)) to join the mailinglist.

## Issues

Issues are collected online in several issue-trackers:

- [Github issues](https://github.com/umlaeute/Gem/issues) - mainly targeted at the development process

- [Bugs](https://sourceforge.net/p/pd-gem/bugs) (SourceForge) - this is where most end-users report their problems

- [Feature Requests](https://sourceforge.net/p/pd-gem/feature-requests) (SourceForge) - this is where most end-users report their feature requests

# Coding Style

Gem's Coding style is not very formalized.
However, there are some implicit assumptions.

There is a [draft document](https://github.com/umlaeute/Gem/blob/master/doc/CodingStyle.txt)
that tries to sum up the current practice.
