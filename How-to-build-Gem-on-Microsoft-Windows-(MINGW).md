This document describes how to build Gem on W32 using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org)


## Requirements

### MinGW

You need [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org) in order to install Gem.
Get the newest installer from their [website](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started),
and install (at least):

 - mingw-developer-toolkit
 - mingw32-base
 - mingw32-gcc-g++
 - msys-base

### Pure data

You need the Pure data sources to build Gem, either the Vanilla or Extended version.
The easiest way is to download a zip for Windows from [http://puredata.info/downloads](http://puredata.info/downloads).
Then unpack it.
